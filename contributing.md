We would love to have help developing this further. The following are a few expansions that can be made.

If you would like the public extension to be updated to reflect the github pease email ruben uribe at uriben2000@gmail.com.

# Import/Export KeyCuts & Spaces
save keycuts and spaces to a json file, and have a method of importing a json with keycuts and spaces. 

# Improve Search AI.
The search AI can be found in the function getBeforeURL in the src/utils.js file. Expanding this function to not be reliant on history, and include other potential url stirngs woukd increase the usibility of the KeyCut Extension.
